Todo list
---------

5 * uasValidatorCheckPassword -> rules in the help message!
3 * when changing the language, redirect to the referer.

1 * embedded form for identifications!
1 * Add Unix accounts in the edit of a user
1 * Create embedded forms for ftp and unix (see samba as reference)
  * Frontend:

3	- add listing of accounts on the show page (<?php var_dump($user->getSambaAccounts()) ?>)
2	- if you try to register a new user - logout if still logged in
		$this->getUser->setAuthenticated(false); in the correct action...
4	- provide a printable version of the detail page
5 * remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
3 * add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)
5 * restrict the correct pages to the correct credentials as you see fit
5 * Redo the complete header and flash message placements
2 * Translation!
3 * Redo the validation on the current password: --> changePasswordForm.php line 20

	$this->validatorSchema['password'] = new sfValidatorAnd(
		new sfValidatorString(array('required' => true)),
		new uasValidatorCheckPassword()
	);
4 * split out the layouts - logged in and not logged in (backend AND frontend)
3 * When we activate a user the email account home dir needs to be created!

Nice to have
-------------

*  persons picture with the users (image upload)
*  add a "server" table to the system
* Modify filters: in a filter we should not see a dropdown with users, but a input field, (if we have many users the dropdown will be unasable
* ADD unit TESTS
* ADD functional TESTS
