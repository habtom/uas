Todo list
---------
* creating users - auto-generate a password and fill the needed fields
* creating users - auto-generate uid
* creating users - gid should be a drop-down box (2000 - users(*), 2001 - system, 2002 - other)
* creating users - validate email quota field (/^\d[SC]$/)
* creating users - take out the created/updated fields
* creating users - pre-fill the expires-at field with 1 year to now
* aliases "abc@domain.tld goes to def@otherdomain.tld"
* domains -> click the user count to go to a pre-filtered list in the users
* samba -> remove "updated at"
* global -> new and edit should not have the created/updated fields

* remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
* add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)

* ADD TESTS


Nice to have
-------------

* persons picture with the users (image upload)
* links from a user to his unix account / ftp accounts / ...
* a login for the backend, not everyone should be able to use this
* a cooler layout/view
* add a "server" table to the system
