Todo list
---------
* creating users - auto-generate a password and fill the needed fields
  --> to auto generate a password use the unix command 'pwgen' (apt-get install pwgen) : e.g.: pwgen -1 -y -B 
* creating users - validate email quota field (/^\d[SC]$/)
  --> the field in the database has a number followed by a S (or C).  We can ignore the C option and not use it.  But the size is important.  Maybe we should show it in megabyte. and let the user insert in in megabyte.  Maybe we should provide the user with only a dropdown box where he can select X MB (in increments of 100MB.  The field that is written into the database is in bytes.
* creating users - take out the created/updated fields
* creating users - pre-fill the expires-at field with 1 year to now
* aliases "abc@domain.tld goes to def@otherdomain.tld"
* domains -> click the user count to go to a pre-filtered list in the users
* samba -> remove "updated at"
* global -> new and edit should not have the created/updated fields
* remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
* add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)
* Show a list with last viewed users/accounts/... 
* Modify filters: in a filter we should not see a dropdown with users, but a input field, (if we have many users the dropdown will be unasable

* ADD TESTS

* Add the restriction to the backend that you need to login (admin/pa55w0rd)
* Add additional user credentials: admin, secretary, sysadmin
	- get the credentials from the login (admin / sysadmin / secretary)
	- restrict the correct pages to the correct credentials

* Frontend: add login to the frontend, and show the information of the logged in user

DONE
----
* creating users - auto-generate uid
* creating users - gid should be a drop-down box (2000 - users(*), 2001 - system, 2002 - other)

Nice to have
-------------

* persons picture with the users (image upload)
* links from a user to his unix account / ftp accounts / ...
* a login for the backend, not everyone should be able to use this
* a cooler layout/view
* add a "server" table to the system

Figure out why we can't set values in our actions in our admin-constructor (expiry date setting in actions.class.php - executeNew())
