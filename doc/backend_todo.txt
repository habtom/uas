Bugs
----

* plenty but not documented

Todo list
---------
* creating users - auto-generate a password and fill the needed fields
   --> to auto generate a password use the unix command 'pwgen' (apt-get install pwgen): e.g.: pwgen -1 -y -B
  --> implement function in PHP that does the above :)
* remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
* add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)
* Modify filters: in a filter we should not see a dropdown with users, but a input field, (if we have many users the dropdown will be unasable
* Create a script that creates the smbpasswd file
* Reset password functionality needs to be implemented.
* When a user registers
  - the email local part needs to be generated.
  - the password needs to be generated
* After registration the user needs to be redirected to a page where he sees his account details.  Provide a print function
* ADD unit TESTS
* ADD functional TESTS
* Add the restriction to the backend that you need to login (admin/pa55w0rd)
* Add additional user credentials: admin, secretary, sysadmin
	- get the credentials from the login (admin / sysadmin / secretary)
	- restrict the correct pages to the correct credentials
* In in the frontend name, fathers name and grand fathers name should not be editable

Nice to have
-------------

*  persons picture with the users (image upload)
*  links from a user to his unix account / ftp accounts / ...
*  a login for the backend, not everyone should be able to use this
*  a cooler layout/view
*  add a "server" table to the system
*  But the size is important.  Maybe we should show it in megabyte. and let the user insert in in megabyte.  Maybe we should provide the user with only a dropdown box where he can select X MB (in increments of 100MB.  The field that is written into the database is in bytes.

Figure out why we can't set values in our actions in our admin-constructor (expiry date setting in actions.class.php - executeNew())
Figure out why filter_is_empty isn't working as it should
