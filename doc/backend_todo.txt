* none

Todo list
---------
* creating users - auto-generate a password and fill the needed fields
   --> to auto generate a password use the unix command 'pwgen' (apt-get install pwgen): e.g.: pwgen -1 -y -B
  --> implement function in PHP that does the above :)
* creating users - pre-fill the expires-at field with 1 year to now, but the one year is configurable by config file.
* global -> new and edit should not have the created/updated fields
* remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
* add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)
* Show a list with last viewed users/accounts/... 
* Modify filters: in a filter we should not see a dropdown with users, but a input field, (if we have many users the dropdown will be unasable

* ADD TESTS

* Add the restriction to the backend that you need to login (admin/pa55w0rd)
* Add additional user credentials: admin, secretary, sysadmin
	- get the credentials from the login (admin / sysadmin / secretary)
	- restrict the correct pages to the correct credentials



DONE
----
* creating users - auto-generate uid
* creating users - gid should be a drop-down box (2000 - users(*), 2001 - system, 2002 - other)
* creating users - validate email quota field (/^\d[SC]$/)
* creating users - take out the created/updated fields
* aliases "abc@domain.tld goes to def@otherdomain.tld"
* Frontend: add login to the frontend, and show the information of the logged in user
* samba -> remove "created at"
* global -> new and edit should not have the created/updated fields
* Helper for email quata to provide the value in bytes, als the S after the value (validation message)

Nice to have
-------------

* persons picture with the users (image upload)
* links from a user to his unix account / ftp accounts / ...
* a login for the backend, not everyone should be able to use this
* a cooler layout/view
* add a "server" table to the system
*  But the size is important.  Maybe we should show it in megabyte. and let the user insert in in megabyte.  Maybe we should provide the user with only a dropdown box where he can select X MB (in increments of 100MB.  The field that is written into the database is in bytes.

Figure out why we can't set values in our actions in our admin-constructor (expiry date setting in actions.class.php - executeNew())
