All:

* Add all needed functionality to the User::Show action in the backend
* Frontend:
	- add listing of accounts on the show page
	- if you try to register a new user - logout if still logged in
	- provide a printable version of the detail page
* Models/frontend: change password: refactor! Move from controller to models
* Backend: add a Action on the Samba list to get a smbpasswd file (no layout, just one line per user)
* clean up TODO list
* remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
* add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)
* Modify filters: in a filter we should not see a dropdown with users, but a input field, (if we have many users the dropdown will be unasable
* Create a script that creates the smbpasswd file
* After registration the user needs to be redirected to a page with a print function
* ADD unit TESTS
* ADD functional TESTS
* Add additional user credentials: admin, secretary, sysadmin
	- get the credentials from the login (admin / sysadmin / secretary)
	- restrict the correct pages to the correct credentials
* Move the logout link in the backend to a nicer place.
* When we activate a user the email account home dir needs to be created!
* The backend login/pass should be in a config file, not in the coding
* When switching languages - redirect to the page the user was on
* Redo the validation on the current password:
	$this->validatorSchema['password'] = new sfValidatorAnd(
		new sfValidatorString(array('required' => true)),
		new uasValidatorCheckPassword()
	);
* refactor controllers! Fat Models, skinny controllers
* check bernards work on the controllers (changePassword)
* When a user sends a new password in the frontend we must do some checks: e.g.
  * 2 numbers
  * 2 capitals
  * 2 special chars
  * 2 letters
  * Password strenght in general
* Backend, on show user page we need to show the login name too!!
* Print CSS stylesheet (backend)
* Default pages (front and backend), add needed links... (general)

Nice to have
-------------

*  persons picture with the users (image upload)
*  add a "server" table to the system
*  But the size is important.  Maybe we should show it in megabyte. and let the user insert in in megabyte.  Maybe we should provide the user with only a dropdown box where he can select X MB (in increments of 100MB.  The field that is written into the database is in bytes.

Figure out why we can't set values in our actions in our admin-constructor (expiry date setting in actions.class.php - executeNew())
Figure out why filter_is_empty isn't working as it should
